Marker,

On the night of 3/12 - 4/12 I worked at the University over night completing my assignment. Early hours of the morning my Unity project crashed and resulted in data loss of
project in which I only had a couple of hours to try and get back to where I was, which was impossible.

I managed to get hold of christos at around 9:30am 4/12 and he told me just to upload the project as it was.

This project is not complete. The computer that I was using in P225 was very buggy, crashed my Unity and corrupted my Unity Save.

I have reflected this in my report.

I also can not build an APK file for you because the current PC I am on does not have the latest Android SDK (API Level 21) installed and we can not 
install them on University PC's because of the IT usage.

I also could not record a video from the editor (I only have apple products) because we can not install external applications without admin rights.
Drivers 

I'm not expecting a high grade but I have done please take this into consideration when marking.


Again, my apolgies for how untidy this project is.
